## No test instantiates an [EditorPlugin] and the demo project does not enable this one, so a plugin that has
## stopped compiling is invisible to every other check: the addon simply fails to enable in a project that
## installs it, which is the last place anyone wants to find out. Loading a GDScript compiles it, and a
## preload of a file that is not there is a compile error, so a plugin in that state comes back null.

## written relative to the file is the dangerous kind, because a search for "res://" never lands on it.
